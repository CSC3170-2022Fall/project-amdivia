## Data Preparation
The generated raw data is stored in 'info.csv', the code is in 'random_gen.py'. You can change the path and parameters in the code, it will automatically output a csv.

The raw data include: capacity(evaluated by the # of chips), factory machine type, location, simulated occupation status, naive operation time of each operation (no difference between factories, maybe assigned later).
